==========================

# Comments

Comment may be K&R or ANSI-style.

~~~C
/*
  Kerningham & Ritchie style comment
*/

// ANSI one-liner
~~~

# Primitive Types

Signed or unsigned chars and ints are
supported.  Shorts are the same as
ints.

Variable declarations cannot
have initializers with expressions in
them.

~~~C
char  c;
char  c = 0;
char  c = 0 + 1;    ; // No!
short s;
unsigned u; // Short for 'unsigned int'.
int      i;
unsigned char  uc;
unsigned short us;
unsigned int   ii;
~~~

# Pointers

Pointers are always assumed to be of
size 'int' and can be dereferenced only
once within an expression.

~~~C
v = \*p;
v = \*\*p;  // No!
~~~

# Composite Types

## Arrays

Arrays contain any number of elements of
the same type and must have a known size
at declaration time.  Arrays can have
only one dimension only.

~~~C
char array1[5];
char array1[23][42]; // No.
~~~

## Structures And Unions

A 'struct' allows to group up items into
named records.  A 'union' is a struct
where all elements share the same memory
location.  'struct' and 'union' may be
mixed and nested.

Elements an be accessed via the dot
operator '.' is the type is static or
with the arrow operator '->' with a
pointer to it.  But indirections (using
the arrow operator '->') cannot be
queued up.

~~~C
struct btnode {
    char parent;
    char left;
    char right;
    struct 
};

struct btnode n;
struct btnode *parent;
parent = n.parent;
struct btnode *p = &n;
parent = n->parent;

// All members share the same memory
// location.
union {
    char same;
    char memory;
    char location;
    char for_all_four;
};
~~~

# Literal Constants

~~~
'c'         // char
"string"    // char *
23          // decimal
0x1234      // hexadecimal
0XDEADBEEF  // hexadecimal
0755        // octal
{0, 1, 2}   // Array or structure.
~~~

# Variable Initializers

Initializers must be constant.

~~~C
char i = 2;
char k = 1 + 1;     // No.
char array[4];
char array[4 + 1];  // No,
char array[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
char array[4] = {1, 2 + 3, 4}; // No.
struct node {
    char left;
    char right;
} = {1, 2};
~~~

Eventually variables want to be exported
for the linker:

~~~C
extern char global_state;
~~~

# Functions

The must be no forward-declarations and
the return type or argument types do not
matter at call-time.  The return value
may be omitted entirely.  It can also
be declared 'void' alongside the other
data types.

Local variable declarations have to
precede the statements.  They can be
declared static (global variable that
can be accessed from inside the function
only).

~~~C
some_fun(); // No!

// K&R-style argument types.
some_fun (to, have)
char *to;
int  have;
{
    int i;
    static int j;
    return 0;
}

// ANSI-style argument types.
some_fun (char *to, int have)
{
}
~~~

# Control Flow

'goto' is not supported (yet).

## 'return'
## 'if'/'else'
## 'break'
## 'do'/'while'
## 'for'
## 'switch'/'case'/'default'
## 'while'

operand and assign the result to the
left operand.

~~~

### Multiply AND (`*=`)

It multiplies the right operand with the
left operand and assigns the result to
the left operand.

right, assigns the result to the left
operand.

~~~

## List Operator

### Comma (,)

Allows two expressions to be evaluated
in the same statement with the result of
the last expression being the value of
the combined expression.

condition given.

~~~C
